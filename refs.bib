  abstract = {Die hier vorliegende 2. Auflage des Praxishandbuchs zum Deep Learning wurde gründlich aktualisiert und erweitert. Das Werk befasst sich mit Grundkonzepten des Deep Learning und zeigt den Einsatz und das Training von neuronalen Netzen mit Daten. Aufbau und Layout dieser Auflage sind unverändert. Der Inhalt jedoch wurde erweitert und dem technischen Fortschritt angepasst. Im ersten Kapitel befinden sich vier neue Beispiel für die Anwendung von Deep Learning. Das Kapitel zu Python bezieht sich in dieser Auflage auf die Version 3.7 und das Kapitel zum Framework TensorFlow ist komplett aktualisiert. Ausserdem sind vier neue Praxisbeispiele hinzugekommen. Die angepassten Abbildungen und Hinweise unterstützen das Textverständnis weiterhin. Vorausgesetzt werden Grundkenntnisse in Python und JavaScript (zum Benutzen der eingesetzten Frameworks) sowie in Mathematik. Als Einsteigertitel zum Thema besser geeignet ist Andrew W. Trask: "Neuronale Netze und Deep Learning kapieren". Der Vorgänger kann noch im Bestand bleiben. (3)},
